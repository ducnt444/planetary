The crater, discovered in 1974, is surrounded by the Caloris Montes, a ring of mountains approximately 2 km (1.2 mi) tall.',

A terrestrial planet, Venus is sometimes called Earth's 'sister planet' because of their similar size, mass, and proximity to the Sun. Venus has been a major fixture in human culture for as long as records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the 'morning star' and 'evening star'.",
